# Backend Project

This is a TypeScript backend project that serves as a template for building RESTful APIs. It includes a structured approach with controllers, services, models, and utility functions.

## Project Structure

```
backend
├── src
│   ├── index.ts            # Entry point of the application
│   ├── controllers         # Contains route handlers
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── services            # Contains business logic
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── models              # Defines data structures
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── utils               # Utility functions
│       └── index.ts
├── package.json            # NPM configuration
├── tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile TypeScript:**
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```

   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- The application is structured to separate concerns, making it easier to manage and scale.
- Controllers handle incoming requests and responses.
- Services contain the business logic and interact with models.
- Models define the data structure used in the application.
- Utility functions assist with common tasks such as formatting responses and error handling.
